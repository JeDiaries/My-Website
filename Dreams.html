<p style="font-size:140%;"> <font color="BLACK"> <font face="times new roman">There's alot of things to wonder and to do but you only work hard for what you wanted, of the things you like to do the most.&nbspWe all want to be a sucessful person someday but me, besides of that dream,
I have this inside of me the <strong><i>passion</i></strong>, the <strong><i>love for environment,humanity</i></strong> and <strong><i>service</i></strong>.I wanted to be a person who is not just earning money but a person who is <strong><q>passionate and helpful in the society</q></strong>. When I was young my Mother always told me to be a Nurse once I graduate in college.&nbsp I feel like I can do it but as the time passes by it made me feel like I am not mentally fit to it. I want to be a Veterinarian or a Marine Biologist or someone who is in the DENR,DFAR &nbsp But after my Grandmother had diagnosed in a coma, Life really slapped me so hard. The feeling
that I can't do anything.&nbspI'm just sitting there waiting for crap results I feel like I'm the most useless person that time, I mean what do I know I'm just a piece of crap waiting until someone would recyle me.&nbsp It really opened my world, my interest about Nursing.&nbspI can do it,I 
will be.&nbspBecause you are not what others think about you or say about you. You are you because of what you believe. <strong><q>Claim it and Be it! </q></strong> </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"> <font color="BLACK"> <font face="times new roman">Maybe that's how a person could learn her purpose because I am not just a student, a daughter or anything else. I am a person who has a big part to others.I know sometimes we are not what we wanted to be but I do 
believe in God that no matter what happen God has a purpose and plan for me.I just cant't help my self with this burning desire of surviving, living my life and to serve people. <strong>xoxo JerechaG</strong> </p>
