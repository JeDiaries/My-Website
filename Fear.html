<p style="font-size:140%;"> <font color="BLACK"> <font face="times new roman">When we were young, we are thought about all the <strong>scariest</strong> creature you'll incounter in the dark.&nbsp Shadows,white lady,Giants,drawfs,all those myths that we are all afraid of in our childhood.&nbspWe are all afraid of the <strong>Dark</strong> I remember when I was young I used to open all the light in our house especially when I'am alone.
I hate it when I'm the only one who is still awake and everyone is sleeping because I always wake them up. I can't sleep if the light is off because I feel like something will just pop out in the dark and I'll die. All those scary things in our Childhood change as we grow up. I am the most  <i>oa</i> in terms of Horror movies before,I was like covering my whole
face with pillow while watching horror film imagine how stupid I am. I do <strong>cry</strong> most of the time when my family tease me about ghost. Dark is really terrifying. I grew up with a fear of ghost and it's not funny anymore because my mom gets mad when I wake her up at night because I can't sleep.&nbsp Then suddenly I have to attend to my confirmation thats the time I started
wondering why do I fear ghost? I am with God and starting that day I realized there's a bigger things to be afraid of. I am scared to be alone because All my life I feel like I am alone.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"> <font color="BLACK"> <font face="times new roman">I'm scared of lossing people I valued the most even though sooner I realized that they didn't think of me the same as How I valued them. I'm scared of lossing memories, I'm scared of failures.
That was what I think before I fear Faiulres, I'm scared of people. All those people who will put you down,make fun of you and hurt you and after letting them hurt me,absorbing all the pain I said to myself <strong><q><i>stop! it is too much.</i></q></strong> That's the time I want a change. I come nearer to God and realized how lucky I am for what I have it's because I'm just focusing
only to myself that I can't see the others nor appreciate all the things they've done to me. I was locked up in the thoughts of <strong>Failure</strong> without even trying. I'm not planning for revenge or anything because It wont make me sucessful. I just open up my heart to God and to my family I start realizing my worth,acceppting my flaws,and start Trying/doing my best.&nbspSometimes 
we are the only one who make things complicated. I used to listen <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> speech because It really show me what's more in me. I qouted <strong><q>If you want change,change your mind first</q> xoxo JerechaG </p>
