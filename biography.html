it just happened that me and my seatmates have similar sound of our first name and sometimes I get confused when my classmates say <i>"je"</i> because my former classmates used to call me <i>"je"</i>&nbsp me,jea,and ericka we all have that similar sound of name and I get confused most of the time so I decided that why not changed it to <strong><em> "Ziricha"</strong> </em>.&nbsp I live in Cotabato City , Philippines.&nbspI am a of
course a <i>Pilipina</i>.&nbspI'm the eldest among my siblings. &nbspBoth of my parents have their own family but that doesn't mean that I am a rebelous daughter because I'm not.&nbspI am living with my grandmother since I was 2 years old up to today.&nbspI was raised by my <i>lolas</i>, they spoiled me haha I love them so much.</p>
