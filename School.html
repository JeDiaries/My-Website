<p style="font-size:140%;"> <font color="BLACK"> <font face="times new roman">We spend almost half of our lives studying in school.&nbsp In every year we spent atleast 10 months studying the lessons, answering quizes,weeken homework, and feel so blessed everytime the class was being suspended.&nbsp 
In my 11 years of studying right now,&nbsp as I was doing this silly thoughts of mine I'm about to give up but still here I am fighting. <strong><i>aja!</i></strong>.&nbspSchool was so much fun yet exhausting.&nbsp Ever since we were young we are tought how to count numbers which we always do, now that we're grown up.
<counting money)In school it's like riding a <strong>roller coaster</strong> we are going through alot of things, ups , downs , and mix emotions. The emotion when you have failed grades but so does your friends, I mean it's not being irresponsible of your actions because sometimes there are instances that even if we try very hard
it's just, it seems like it is not good enough.It is said <q>The tougher you encounter in the school, the worst you encounter outside</q>.&nbspBut of course the school wouldn't be a school without the students and the teachers.&nbspThe school really shaped me,molded me it's really a second home to, there are times that all of us against
the quiz, we'll keep quite until our teacher is done to her lesson and the she'll forget about our quiz. <i>yay!</i> I love waking up 6am when I had a 5am class and woke up 6:30am with 7am class I'm like <strong><i><q> the super flash </q> </i></strong> I can literally show within 5 minutes if I'm not mistaken. I'm so grateful to all of
my Teachers because they were the one who tought me all of this I mean not all but they were such a big part of it. All those pressures I must deal with, advices that I can share to others, and lessons I cary wherever I go. <strong>Thank you so much Teachers.</strong> You're waiting for me to tell my crushes did you? they're too many to mention
let's not include them anyway they are just fun to see, on the hallway,in the canteen, anywhere they are so cute the end! </p>

sure after all the discussion,all the projects,all of those sleepless nights and all of those moments you spend together with your classmates..&nbspOne day you'll going to miss them all..&nbspWhat I am saying is that everything will passsed by like what I am doing right now it's so late but I've to finish this stuff becausse it will pass by..&nbsp <strong><q><mark>Tomorrow is another day!</strong></q></mark> <strong>xoxo JerechaG</strong> </p>
